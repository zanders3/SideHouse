It has recently been released on the Unity Asset Store.\r\n\r\nIt allows you to optimise your lightmap UV usage by adjusting the lightmap scales of each object in your scene quickly, with all changes made displayed instantly.\r\n\r\nUsers can expect to get 85-90% lightmap texel usage up from the 20-30% found by default. The tool can also help debug light bleeding issues by showing exactly where a specific mesh is located in the lightmap.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving problems? If you need support or have questions, comments or feedback it would be great to hear from you! Please email support@sidehouse.co.uk and we'll get back to you.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
